# Super_Hexagon
This is my first ever game that I made in unity. 
In this game you have a player that is in the middle and there are hexagons closing in on the middle. However there is a gap in every hexagon for the player to go through. 
The player has to go through the gap to survive. If the player get hit by the hexagon the game resets.
